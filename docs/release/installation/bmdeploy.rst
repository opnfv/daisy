Installation Guide (Bare Metal Deployment)
==========================================

Nodes Configuration (Bare Metal Deployment)
-------------------------------------------

The below file is the inventory template of deployment nodes:

"./deploy/config/bm_environment/zte-baremetal1/deploy.yml"

You can write your own name/roles reference into it.

        - name -- Host name for deployment node after installation.

        - roles -- Components deployed. CONTROLLER_LB is for Controller,
COMPUTER is for Compute role. Currently only these two role is supported.
The first CONTROLLER_LB is also used for ODL controller. 3 hosts in
inventory will be chosen to setup the Ceph storage cluster.

**Set TYPE and FLAVOR**

E.g.

.. code-block:: yaml

    TYPE: virtual
    FLAVOR: cluster

**Assignment of different roles to servers**

E.g. OpenStack only deployment roles setting

.. code-block:: yaml

    hosts:
      - name: host1
        roles:
          - CONTROLLER_LB
      - name: host2
        roles:
          - COMPUTER
      - name: host3
        roles:
          - COMPUTER


NOTE:
For B/M, Daisy uses MAC address defined in deploy.yml to map discovered nodes to node items definition in deploy.yml, then assign role described by node item to the discovered nodes by name pattern. Currently, controller01, controller02, and controller03 will be assigned with Controler role while computer01, 'computer02, computer03, and computer04 will be assigned with Compute role.

NOTE:
For V/M, There is no MAC address defined in deploy.yml for each virtual machine. Instead, Daisy will fill that blank by getting MAC from "virsh dump-xml".


Network Configuration (Bare Metal Deployment)
------------------------------------------

Before deployment, there are some network configurations to be checked based
on your network topology. The default network configuration file for Daisy is
"./deploy/config/bm_environment/zte-baremetal1/network.yml".
You can write your own reference into it.

**The following figure shows the default network configuration.**

Note:
For Flat External networks(which is used by default), a physical interface is needed on each compute node for ODL NetVirt recent versions.
HeartBeat network is selected,and if it is configured in network.yml,the keepalived interface will be the heartbeat interface.

Start Deployment (Bare Metal Deployment)
----------------------------------------

(1) Git clone the latest daisy4nfv code from opnfv: "git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/daisy"

(2) Download latest bin file(such as opnfv-2017-06-06_23-00-04.bin) of daisy from
http://artifacts.opnfv.org/daisy.html and change the bin file name(such as opnfv-2017-06-06_23-00-04.bin)
to opnfv.bin. Check the https://build.opnfv.org/ci/job/daisy-os-odl-nofeature-ha-baremetal-daily-master/,
and if the 'snaps_health_check' of functest result is 'PASS',
you can use this verify-passed bin to deploy the openstack in your own environment

(3) Assumed cloned dir is $workdir, which laid out like below:
[root@daisyserver daisy]# ls
ci    deploy      docker  INFO         LICENSE    requirements.txt       templates   tests  tox.ini
code  deploy.log  docs    known_hosts  setup.py   test-requirements.txt  tools
Make sure the opnfv.bin file is in $workdir

(4) Enter into the $workdir, which laid out like below:
[root@daisyserver daisy]# ls
ci  code  deploy  docker  docs  INFO  LICENSE  requirements.txt  setup.py  templates  test-requirements.txt  tests  tools  tox.ini
Create folder of labs/zte/pod2/daisy/config in $workdir

(5) Move the ./deploy/config/bm_environment/zte-baremetal1/deploy.yml and
./deploy/config/bm_environment/zte-baremetal1/network.yml
to labs/zte/pod2/daisy/config dir.

Note:
If selinux is disabled on the host, please delete all xml files section of below lines in dir templates/physical_environment/vms/
  <seclabel type='dynamic' model='selinux' relabel='yes'>
    <label>system_u:system_r:svirt_t:s0:c182,c195</label>
    <imagelabel>system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c182,c195</imagelabel>
  </seclabel>

(6) Config the bridge in jumperserver,make sure the daisy vm can connect to the targetnode,use the command below:
brctl addbr br7
brctl addif br7 enp3s0f3(the interface for jumperserver to connect to daisy vm)
ifconfig br7 10.20.7.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
service network restart

(7) Run the script deploy.sh in daisy/ci/deploy/ with command:
sudo ./ci/deploy/deploy.sh -L $(cd ./;pwd) -l zte -p pod2 -s os-nosdn-nofeature-noha

Note:
The value after -L should be a absolute path which points to the directory which contents labs/zte/pod2/daisy/config directory.
The value after -p parameter(pod2) comes from path "labs/zte/pod2"
The value after -l parameter(zte) comes from path  "labs/zte"
The value after -s "os-nosdn-nofeature-ha" used for deploy multinode openstack
The value after -s "os-nosdn-nofeature-noha" used for deploy all-in-one openstack

(8) When deploy successfully,the floating ip of openstack is 10.20.7.11,
the login account is "admin" and the password is "keystone"
