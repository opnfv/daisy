Project Gating And Daily Deployment Test
----------------------------------------

To save time, currently, Daisy4NFV does not run deployment test in gate job which simply builds and
uploads artifacts to low confidence level repo. The project deployment test is triggered on a daily
basis. If the artifact passes the test, then it will be promoted to the high confidence level repo.

The low confidence level artifacts are bin files in http://artifacts.opnfv.org/daisy.html named like
"daisy/opnfv-Gerrit-39495.bin", while the high confidence level artifacts are named like
"daisy/opnfv-2017-08-20_08-00-04.bin".

The daily project deployment status can be found at
