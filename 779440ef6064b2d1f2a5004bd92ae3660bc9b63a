      "message": "According to https://build.opnfv.org/ci/job/daisy4nfv-verify-build-master/463/console. It seems \"sudo docker stop -t 2 daisy\" did not wait until the container was fully removed, so the next command \"sudo docker rm -v -f daisy\" got error \"removal of container daisy is already in progress\"? , So I hope a delay here can workaround this problem. Just try.\n\nOr maybe it is a bug of docker( refer to https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29040). If this delay does not help, we need to dive into this a little bit more.",
