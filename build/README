--- Networking considerations ---

By default, tenant_network_types in ml2_conf.ini only has one item 'vxlan'.
In order to support other types of network (such as vlan), create a file
'/etc/kolla/config/neutron-openvswitch-agent/ml2_conf.ini' with content:

[ml2]
tenant_network_types = vxlan,vlan

The operator can make these changes even after services were already deployed 
by using following command

kolla-ansible reconfigure
